- for this project, fonts are in `public/assets/fonts` & added first to the `fonts.css` file, then imported into the `index.css` file, which has all the tailwind stuff.


## Misc
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.dev/), [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/), [Tablericons](https://tablericons.com/)
- This is essentially an opinionated version of [Taylor Bryant's starter](https://github.com/oddstronaut/next-starter-tailwind).
